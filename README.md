<h1 align="center" id="title">Gnomenciaga</h1>

<p id="description">This is an e-commerce store selling gnomes built with React and Tailwind CSS. Inspired by Applications in the Interpreted Languages course at TUL - refactored to make it more frontend-focused with emphasis on accessibility responsive design and current web design trends (such as neubrutalism). My own personal project to keep learning aside from studies.

[PROJECT IN PROGRESS]
